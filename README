<h1>IPC144 winter 2020 Assignment 2 Milestone 4</h1>

Hello, my name is Nobue Sato.
This is my code for Assignment 2 Milestone 4 for IPC144 winter 2020 at Seneca college.

<h2>Milestones (ms, MS)</h2>
The milestones are a breakdown of a project assigned to students within the last parts of the course.
It's usually more difficult than workshops. This time, It's broken down into 4 parts. 

<h2>note</h2>
as2ms4.c file has already been provided by the professor. 
Most of the time, students are asked to use specific functions or logic to make a solution to reinforce students about those logic, functions and rules.
